# We have some Docker images (e.g. playwright, pa11y) that are quite large
# and take a while to build (~2m), but don't change that much -- they're
# self-contained and only need to change when we add new tests.
#
# To save us building it every time we use it, this script caches built
# images in an ECR repo.
#
# In particular, it pushes new Docker images with two tags:
#
#   - latest
#   - the Git commit ref
#
# so downstream builds can just pull "weco/$name:latest", and this
# script makes sure that tag always reflects the latest copy of these tests.
